## Learning Curve Analysis ##

I made This simple program to display learning effect in a table. I made it as a means of quickly seeing the results, and also to test my  
understanding of the topic. It is still unfinished at this stage and, currently, input is directly through code.

Generally, learning curve analysis deals with how the time or cost to perform tasks reduces as the task is being performed repeatedly, due to  
the assumption that people learn, and become more efficient as they do the same thing over, and over again. But where the reduction is  
assumed to take place depends on the model adopted. The models are the <b>Cumulative Average</b> model and the <b>Incremental Unit</b>  model. The   
cumulative average model assumes the average time or cost it takes to perform one task of many would decrease by a constant percentage as  
the number of tasks to perform is doubled. The incremental unit model assumes the reduction occurs in the additional(last) unit. Meaning  
when the task to perform is doubled, the additional time or cost it would take to perform the last task would decrease by a constant  
percentage. But, irrespective of the model adopted, the reduction could be found using the formula: <b>Y = aX<sup>b</sup></b>.
